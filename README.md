# PIC32 Assembly Coding MIPS processor

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a lab assignment that explores the use of the PIC32 microcontroller, which is based on the MIPS processor architecture. The lab focuses on programming the PIC32 using assembly language, covering topics such as input/output (I/O) control, LED manipulation, and debouncing techniques.

## Description
The lab is divided into several sections, each addressing a specific task:

1. **Introduction to PIC32 and I/O Control**: This section introduces the PIC32 microcontroller and demonstrates how to control input/output (I/O) pins, including turning on and off LEDs.

2. **Debouncing Techniques**: This section explores the issue of switch debouncing, which is a common problem when dealing with mechanical switches. The code demonstrates how to implement a debouncing algorithm to ensure reliable input detection.

3. **BCD Conversion and Display**: This part of the lab covers the conversion of decimal numbers to Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) format and the display of the result on LED outputs.

4. **BCD Multiplication**: The lab also includes a task that performs BCD multiplication and displays the result on the LED outputs.

5. **Button-Controlled LED Toggling**: The final section of the lab demonstrates how to toggle the state of an LED using a button press, with the LED remaining in the new state until the button is pressed again.

## Usage
To use this repository, you will need a PIC32 development board and the necessary software tools, such as a compiler and programming utilities. The code provided in this repository can be used as a starting point for your own PIC32 projects or as a reference for learning assembly programming on the MIPS architecture.
